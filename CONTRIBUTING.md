# Contributing Guidelines

## Submitting Issues

Before submitting an issue, check the [existing GitHub issues][1] to ensure it has not already been
reported. If no issue exists, follow one of the issue templates provided. Follow the instructions
left in the comments (delimited by `<!-- ... -->`).

## Pull Requests

Before submitting a PR, check the [issues][1] and [open PRs][2] to see whether it has already been
covered. Each PR should correspond to an issue; this may not be necessary for some PRs, but we
reserve the right to reject PRs on the basis that they were not first discussed in an issue.

When you create the PR, please follow the pull request template. We will reject PRs that do not
follow the instructions left in the comments of the template.
